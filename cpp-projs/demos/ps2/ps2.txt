Problem Description:
Write a complete C++ program that calculates the Simple Interest earned on a given principal amount using a function.

The formula for Simple Interest is:

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

Given Information:

        Principal (P): Initial amount of money (double)
        Rate (R): Annual interest rate (double, given as a percentage — e.g., 5 for 5%)
        Time (T): Time in years (double)

Program Requirements:

1. Define a function named calculateInterest that accepts three arguments:

        principal (P)
        rate (R)
        time (T)
        The function should return the calculated interest as a double.

2. Inside the function:

        Convert the percentage rate to a decimal (e.g., 5% → 0.05).

        Use the formula:
        Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

        Return the computed interest.

3. In the main() function:

        Declare and initialize the following sample values:

        Principal = 10000.0  
        Rate = 4.5  
        Time = 2.0


        Call the calculateInterest() function and store the result.
        Display the Principal, Rate, Time, and Simple Interest.

4. Format the output to display the interest value in fixed-point notation with four (4) decimal places of precision.


Sample Input and Output:

Sample Input:

Principal: 10000
Rate: 4.5
Time: 2


Sample Output:

Principal: 10000
Rate: 4.5%
Time: 2 years
Simple Interest: 900.0000
