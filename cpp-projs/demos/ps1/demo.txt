Problem Description:
Write a complete C++ program that determines a studentâ€™s eligibility for an Academic Award based on two criteria: their Grade Weighted Average (GWA) and their Discipline Record.

Instructions:
    
    1. Ask the user to input the student's Grade Weighted Average (GWA) as a floating-point number.

    2. Ask the user to input the number of major offenses the student has committed as an integer.

    3. The student is eligible for an Academic Award if and only if both of the following conditions are met:
            The GWA is less than or equal to 2.00.
            The student has committed zero major offenses.

    4. If the student is eligible, display:
            [GWA] - Academic Award Candidate

    5. If the student is not eligible, determine the specific reason:

            If the GWA is greater than 2.00 and the student has zero offenses, display:

            [GWA] - Needs Improvement in Grades


            If the GWA is less than or equal to 2.00 and the student has one or more offenses, display:

            [GWA] - Needs Improvement in Discipline


            Otherwise (the GWA is greater than 2.00 and the student has one or more offenses), display:

            [GWA] - Not Eligible for Awards


    6. The GWA must be displayed with exactly two decimal places of precision.`

Sample Input 1

GWA: 1.75
Offenses: 0

Sample Output 1

1.75 - Academic Award Candidate

Sample Input 2

GWA: 2.50
Offenses: 0

Sample Output 2

2.50 - Needs Improvement in Grades

Sample Input 3

GWA: 1.80
Offenses: 1

Sample Output 3

1.80 - Needs Improvement in Discipline

Sample Input 4

GWA: 2.75
Offenses: 2

Sample Output 4

2.75 - Not Eligible for Awards
