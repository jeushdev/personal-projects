Problem: Fix the Defective Sum-Even-Numbers Program

The C++ program below is intended to define a function sumEvenNumbers that calculates and returns the sum of all even numbers 
from $1$ up to a given positive integer $N$ (inclusive). However, the code contains multiple errors (syntax, logical, and 
structural) that prevent it from compiling or running correctly.

Your task is to identify and fix ALL errors so that the program runs as intended, and then write the complete, corrected code. 
List the errors you found and how you fixed them.

Expected Output for Input $N=10$:
The sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is: 30

Initial Code (with errors):

#include <iostream>

// Function definition - intended to sum evens up to limit
int sumEvenNumbers(int limit)
{
    int sum; // MISTAKE 1: Variable declaration
    for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i + 1) // MISTAKE 2: Loop construct
    {
        if (limit % 2 == 0); // MISTAKE 3: Conditional logic
        {
            sum = sum + i; // MISTAKE 4: Logic/Variable use
        }
    }
    return limit; // MISTAKE 5: Return value
}

void main() // MISTAKE 6: Main function signature
{
    int N = 10;
    int result = sumEvenNumbers(N) // MISTAKE 7: Syntax

    std.cout << "The sum of even numbers from 1 to " << N << " is: " << result << std::endl;
}
